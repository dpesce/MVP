        <!-- intro material -->
        <p>
            The MVP aims to realize very-long-baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations of (sub)millimeter water megamasers residing in the accretion disks around active galactic nuclei (AGN).  The first stage of the MVP involves identifying which (sub)millimeter transitions exhibit maser activity.  To this end, we have been awarded ALMA time (<a href="http://almascience.org/aq/?project_code=2024.1.00211.S">Project 2024.1.00211.S</a>) to carry out a spectral sweep of the Circinus Galaxy across the full set of ALMA Bands 1-10 (covering a frequency range of ~35-950 GHz).
        </p>
        <p>
            This page provides a current snapshot of the project status.  Some high-level notes:
            <ul>
                <li>The material presented here uses the ALMA QA2 data products directly.  I.e., no additional calibration or imaging has yet been carried out.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <!-- broadband spectrum -->
        <section>
            <h2>Broadband spectrum of Circinus AGN</h2>
            <p>
                The plot below shows a continuum-subtracted ALMA spectrum of the central AGN in the Circinus Galaxy.
            </p>
            <iframe src="plots/spectrum.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
            <br>
            <p>
                The spectrum shown here has been extracted from the location corresponding to the brightest continuum point, which we assume to be coincident with the central AGN, and it has been smoothed using a 20 MHz boxcar average.  Note that emission from some species becomes more evident only after integrating over a larger region, but such spatially-extended emission is presumably not associated with the AGN.

        <!-- identified species -->
        <section>
            <h2>Identified species</h2>
            <p>
                Emitting species that have been identified in the Circinus spectrum thus far are listed here.  When quoting frequencies, we indicate both the rest-frame as well as the redshifted version of the frequency (corresponding to the Circinus Galaxy's redshift of \(z=0.001448\)) as [rest-frame]/<font color="salmon">[redshifted]</font> GHz.  Emission from most of the transitions listed below is spatially extended well outside of the central region of the galaxy.

                <ul>
                    <li>There is an absorption line at about 36.99/<font color="salmon">36.94</font> GHz that may be hydroxyl (OH).</li>
                    <li>There is a low-intensity but rather broad emission line at about 135.30/<font color="salmon">135.10</font> GHz that may be the \(4_{1,4}\)-\(3_{1,3}\) rotational transition of thioformaldehyde (H<sub>2</sub>CS).  On closer investigation, it looks as though emission from this line is concentrated in the nucleus and is substantially broader (in linewidth) than the more extended molecular emission.  There are no water lines within ~2 GHz (~4000 km/s) of this frequency; could it be another species producing nuclear emission?</li>
                    <li>There are a number of unidentified lines.</li>

                <h2>Spectral energy distribution (SED) for Circinus AGN</h2>
                <p>
                    The plot on the right shows continuum and spectral index information corresponding to each of the individual ALMA observations.  The spectral index \(\alpha\) is defined such that
                    $$S_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\alpha} .$$
                    The plotted values have been extracted from the brightest continuum point in each image, which we assume to be coincident with the central AGN.  Shaded regions indicate approximate 1\(\sigma\) statistical uncertainties, though we note that these values come directly from the ALMA QA2 data and do not reflect potential systematic uncertainties in, e.g., flux calibration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because these observations have been conducted at different times and are not typically well-matched in angular resolution, we do not expect the recovered SED to necessarily be continuous.  Furthermore, the limited angular resolution means that some fraction -- and potentially the majority -- of the emission contributing to any particular SED measurement will originate from material far from the AGN.  The plotted SED can thus be considered to provide an upper limit on the underlying AGN SED.
