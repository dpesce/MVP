        <!-- intro material -->

        <p>
            The MVP aims to realize very-long-baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations of (sub)millimeter water megamasers residing in the accretion disks around active galactic nuclei (AGN).  The first stage of the MVP involves identifying which (sub)millimeter transitions exhibit maser activity.  To this end, we have been awarded ALMA time (<a href="http://almascience.org/aq/?project_code=2024.1.00211.S">Project 2024.1.00211.S</a>) to carry out a spectral sweep of the Circinus Galaxy across the full set of ALMA Bands 1-10 (covering a frequency range of ~35-950 GHz).
        </p>
        <p>
            This page provides a current snapshot of the project status.  Some high-level notes:
            <ul>
                <li>The analyses presented here use the ALMA QA2 data products directly.  I.e., no additional calibration or imaging has yet been carried out.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <p>
                The interactive plot below shows a continuum-subtracted ALMA spectrum of the central AGN in the Circinus Galaxy.

                <h2>Spectral energy distribution (SED) for Circinus AGN</h2>
                <p>
                    The plot on the right shows continuum and spectral index information corresponding to each of the individual ALMA observations.  The spectral index \(\alpha\) is defined such that
                    $$S_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\alpha} .$$
                    The plotted values have been extracted from the brightest continuum point in each image, which we assume to be coincident with the central AGN.  Shaded regions indicate approximate 1\(\sigma\) statistical uncertainties, though we note that these values come directly from the ALMA QA2 data and do not reflect potential systematic uncertainties in, e.g., flux calibration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because these observations have been conducted at different times and are not typically well-matched in angular resolution, we do not expect the recovered SED to necessarily be continuous.  Furthermore, the limited angular resolution means that some fraction -- and potentially the majority -- of the emission contributing to any particular SED measurement will originate from material far from the AGN.  The plotted SED can thus be considered to provide an upper limit on the underlying AGN SED.
